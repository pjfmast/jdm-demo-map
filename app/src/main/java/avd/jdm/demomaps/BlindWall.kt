Inspired by the nearby parking lot history; from vegetable garden to graveyard and the former stables at the end of the street.\n \nIllustrator Laura Lehtinen (FI) studied illustration in Barcelona, where she first got into painting walls. Nowadays she works on magazine and commercial illustration and designs installations in urban spaces. Her work is inspired by nature, traveling, hip hop and skateboarding culture, Tove Jansson (Finnish novelist, painter and illustrator), gastronomy, fashion and love."

Volunteers were needed to clean up the remains of 400-500 dead civilians.\n \nRobin Nas aka Zenk One (NL) became well-known for his realistic portraits that he later started mixing with a more graphic style.

The undeveloped site of the former CSM site is one of the last memories of this industry. When the wind blows in the right direction, the Perfetti Van Melle factory down the street adds a sweet dimension to the painting.\n \nBrothers Rob and Barry van Dijck together form the graphic design studio Staynice. Their work is characterized by the playful combination of information, illustration and typography. Experiments on their own RISO printer often serve as inspiration for commercial projects for international clients. Yet they remain true to their roots and regular take up spray cans for murals."

Artists “Sticky Fingers” from Breda (NL) and Gent (BE) were inspired by the interesting contrast around the area of the Gasthuisvelden. The military took the place between the river Mark and the Haagdijk to use it as a military drill yard in 1682. In 1960 it was home to the Tax and Customs administration and in the eighties it housed a court. Briefly summarised, the area balances between coercion and nursing, between orders and free will and between machine and human. This project was established by KOP, Blind Walls Gallery and Sticky Fingers Graffiti."

In the twentieth century the railway marked the division between the ‘rich’ center of town and the ‘working class’ north. But in the recent years the Belcrum district turned into a hotspot. For his mural in Breda Ben Eine (UK) got inspiration from the old and vanished industry at the site. Instead of referring to history the words “Meaningful”, “Imagineer”, “Mesmerising”, “Storytelling” celebrate the present and future industry of Breda. The city is known as ‘City of Imagineers’ a home for many educational, cultural and commercial institutions in the creative industry.\n \nBen Eine claims there is a clear distinction between graffiti and street art. To his opinion graffiti makes the streets ugly ,while street art beautifies it. He knows from experience as he had been tagging trains and walls since the age of 14. At some point he felt existing graffiti artists were creating designs that were entirely similar and therefore lacked interest. He wanted to do something different. He was always interested in letters and how they could change shape when combined into words, so this is the direction he took."

Only in 1731 came the name ‘Achter de Vlaszak’ (behind the flax bag). Most likely this is due to the house on the corner that had the name ‘Vlaszak’. It’s unknown why this house was called this way, perhaps the man who lived here was a flax trader.
